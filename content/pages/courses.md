# How to Make a Dialectical Plan

<img align="right" width="60%" src="/content/assets/images/presentation-en.jpg">

My course (duration: 3h20) entitled “[How to make a dialectical plan](https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-make-a-dialectical-plan/learn/lecture/32122464#overview)” is online on Udemy.

The course is a pedagogical and practical version of the notions contained in my articles On a Class of Concepts and The Dialectical Plan: For an Alternative to the Paradigm, published in the journal Semiotica. It is a step-by-step method, with exercises, to learn how to make a dialectical plan, using matrices of concepts.

A [version of this course in French language](https://www.udemy.com/course/realiser-un-plan-dialectique-pour-un-sujet-dordre-general/learn/lecture/33157578#overview) is also available.
