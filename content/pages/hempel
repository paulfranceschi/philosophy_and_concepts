The paper, "The Doomsday Argument and Hempel's Problem", delves into the logical intricacies of Hempel's Problem (HP) and its implications in various contexts, notably distinguishing between two cases: the unparadoxical case of a finite urn and the paradoxical case where the reference class is unspecified.

# Hempel's problem: 

# Unparadoxical Case of the Finite Urn:

In this scenario, the equivalence between propositions (H) and (H') is maintained.
Franceschi uses the example of an urn containing a finite, known number of objects (like balls and tetrahedrons of different colors) to illustrate this case.
The propositions (H2) "All balls are red" and (H2') "All non-red objects are non-balls" are equivalent in this context.
Bayesian reasoning is applied to show that the discovery of a new object (like a red ball or a green tetrahedron) in the urn confirms both (H2) and (H2'), demonstrating the non-paradoxical nature of HP in this finite and well-defined context.

# Paradoxical Case with Unspecified Reference Class: Here, the equivalence between (H) and (H') does not hold due to the arbitrary nature of the reference class Z.
The paper discusses how defining the non-X class (e.g., non-ravens) depends on the choice of the reference class Z, which can be arbitrarily broad or narrow.
Various examples are provided where Z could include vastly different entities, from concrete objects to abstract concepts, leading to arbitrary and artificial conclusions.
This arbitrariness in defining Z undermines the objective validity of any Bayesian reasoning applied in this context. It shows that for any given object x, one can construct a reference class Z such that x either confirms or does not confirm (H), making the confirmation of (H) subjective and arbitrary.

The paper argues that in cases where Z is not predetermined by an objective criterion, any conclusions drawn are not objectively valuable, contrasting with the finite urn scenario where Z is predefined and objective.

In summary, Franceschi's paper highlights the stark contrast in the logical behavior of Hempel's Problem depending on the context: in a finite, well-defined scenario, the equivalence of (H) and (H') holds true and can be objectively confirmed through Bayesian reasoning. However, in cases where the reference class is unspecified and subject to arbitrary definition, this equivalence breaks down, rendering any conclusions drawn from such a setup subjective and unreliable.
